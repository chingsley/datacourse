       "['Smurfette is a female Smurf who was created by Gargamel. She originally had black hair, though when Papa Smurf made her good, her hair became blonde. Before the smurflings created Sassette, Smurfette was the only female smurf in the Smurf village. Most of the time Smurfette is portrayed as an object of admiration of many other Smurfs, since she is the only female Smurf constantly in the village. She is usually hopeless in times of danger and sometimes thinks she knows it all, yet has a caring side as well.',\n",
       " \"Papa Smurf is the leader and elder of the Smurfs and can be easily distinguished by his red clothes and bushy white beard. The Smurfs turn to Papa Smurf when things go wrong. Papa Smurf is skilled in making magical spells and potions. He is much older than the other Smurfs (except for Grandpa and Nanny, who are older than Papa). Papa Smurf often serves the other Smurfs with his knowledge and wisdom and usually devises a plan for how to get out of trouble or to save the Smurf village from attacks by Gargamel. Unlike the other male Smurfs, Papa Smurf's trousers and hat are red instead of white.\",\n",
       " \"Hefty Smurf has incredible strength and often is seen doing a lot of the heavy work in the village. He also has a tattoo on his right arm (or sometimes both of his arms) of a red heart with an arrow through it. His favorite activity is lifting weights and doing other forms of exercise, and is often the one to kick Brainy out of the village whenever he is boasting. Hefty takes pride in being tough, sometimes doing it just for attention. Papa appoints Hefty as the leader of the Smurfs in season 3: Handy's Kite. In several episodes, Papa selects Hefty and Handy as leaders of separate teams in dangerous missions (season 1: Smurfette's Dancing Shoes; season 4: Hopping Cough Smurfs). In The Lost Village, he is one of the four main Smurf protagonists and is in love with Smurfette.\",\n",
       " 'Brainy Smurf considers himself the most intelligent Smurf in the village and an expert on everything, although his actual knowledge is questionable at best; often, his attempts to help in a given situation lead to even more problems. He can be distinguished from the others by the large glasses he wears. He also has archived his self-perceived wit and wisdom in several volumes of books entitled \"The Quotations of Brainy Smurf\". The Smurfs most often respond to his self-righteous preaching by either tossing him out of the village or clobbering him with a club (usually off screen). Most of the time, the other Smurfs never listen to him. His original name translates to \"Smurf with Glasses\".',\n",
       " 'Grouchy Smurf is the misanthropic grouch of the Smurf village. His catchphrase is \"I hate (something somebody else mentions)\" yet it is shown during the show that he is a good observer and notices kindness in others even if he is not playing active role in an event. Even though Grouchy Smurf portrays a role of a moaner within the group, he mostly wishes others to be happy and successful in order to get out of a problematic situation. Grouchy usually has a scowl on his face. In the comics version he was originally a normal Smurf, changed only when bitten by a Bzz fly in the comic story \"The Black Smurfs\" (adapted into English as \"The Purple Smurfs\"). In the cartoon version, he seems to have always have been a grouch. Despite his grouchiness, he has a soft spot for Baby Smurf and the Smurflings. In the movie, his grouchiness is implied to be from insecurity. In Movie 2, he tries to become Positive Smurf, but bad things keep happening to him.',\n",
       " 'Clumsy Smurf is a somewhat dimwitted yet amiable Smurf. In some dangerous situations he is also revealed to be quite brave too. He is distinguished in the cartoon series by his baggy clothing (hat hanging over his eyebrows) which adds to his clumsy appearance (his clothing is normal in the comics). In the animated series, Clumsy speaks in a variety of Southern American English.',\n",
       " \"Greedy is an exceptionally gluttonous Smurf. He has an exceptional interest in eating cakes and other pastry. Greedy usually cannot seem to help himself and he is often chased by Chef Smurf for stealing snacks and food. In the cartoon series, this character was combined with that of Chef Smurf, where he enjoys baking and cooking, but eventually ends up eating his own creations, hence the name. He wears a chef's toque and apron in the comics. In the cartoon, instead of an apron he often wears a napkin around his neck.\",\n",
       " 'Jokey is the village prankster. In the TV cartoon series, Jokey Smurf almost always used the same form of \"joke\"; yellow- and red-wrapped present boxes that he offers to his victims, saying that it is a \"surprise\". When opened, the \"present\" box explodes with a sizable quantity of black smoke which blackens the receiver\\'s face (or entire body depending on the explosion\\'s size). Gargamel is naturally a favorite target, and Brainy is as well.',\n",
       " \"Chef Smurf is the Smurf village's chef. He knows dozens of recipes and cooks many dishes. He always wears his toque blanche (white chef's hat). In the cartoon series, Chef Smurf and Greedy Smurf are combined into the same character. In Volume 11, a Smurf is called Schtroumpf Gourmand, who looks just like Schtroumpf cuisinier (wearing a toque blanche, neckerchief and apron). In Volume 23, Schtroumpf Gourmand is shown wearing the normal Smurf outfit (like he has in all other volumes) and Schtroumpf Cuisinier again wearing the chef outfit, so Volume 12 may have just been a mistake.\",\n",
       " 'Vanity Smurf is the epitome of a narcissist. He has a flower in his hat, and he often holds a hand mirror, staring into his own reflection, which he kisses often. He thinks he is the best-looking of all of the Smurfs. In Movie 2, Vanity becomes Commando Smurf.',\n",
       " 'Handy Smurf (depicted as wearing overalls, a visor attached to the front of his cap, and with a pencil above his ear) is the handyman of the Smurfs. He helps fix things in the village and is known for his amazing technological inventions. He is the inventor of Clockwork Smurf and Clockwork Smurfette.',\n",
       " 'Scaredy Smurf easily gets scared by anything, whether it is a small insect or the noise of a storm. He is often teased by the other Smurfs because of this.',\n",
       " 'Tracker Smurf is a Smurf who is exclusive to the cartoon. He wears a small red feather in his cap and sometimes carries a walking stick. He is an excellent outdoorsman and tracker. He also possesses an excellent sense of smell capable of locating truffles growing underground. In season 2: A Mere Truffle, he receives the Brainy treatment (thrown away or kicked away and lands on his head).',\n",
       " 'Sloppy Smurf is a filthy Smurf with a passion for dirt, garbage, and rotten fruit. His face is perpetually grimy, his hat is grubby and disheveled, and one of his loose stockings is perpetually torn, revealing his toes. Sloppy owns a pet fly named Fly, whom he sometimes walks on a leash and has taught to do tricks like a dog.',\n",
       " \"Harmony Smurf is a musician who especially loves to play the trumpet, although his musical ability shows a total lack of harmony (somewhat like the singing of a certain fictional Armorican bard, or Johan's blonde-haired, diminutive sidekick). Harmony is usually asked to stop playing his trumpet as soon as he gets started. Some English editions name him as Rocker Smurf.\",\n",
       " 'Painter Smurf is a brilliant artist and is active in most visual arts. He often wears a red jacket with a black tie, and is often seen either making a painting or a sculpture.
